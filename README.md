# PatientAid
Welcome! PatientAid is a free, privancy-first solution to empwer patients and healthcare providers to combat COVID-19 together.

As part of a larger initiative from NECSI with the explicit goal of stopping the spread of nCov-2019 / COVID19, it will rely on collaboration among a group of people who volunteer to help from various disciplines to make this happen.

[Join us]() in our fight to end COVID-19.

# About Us & Onboarding
Things here are about PatientAid project and how you can get involved!

## Project Mission
Our project aims to support COVID19 potential patients in great need of medical help, via self-service to make requests to healthcare providers, and to receive the most suitable guidance and action derived from their circumstances in an automated way. 

## How Does PatientAid Work?

PatientAid is a simple and realtime connecting solution that can be used anywhere. Here’s how it works:

1. The patient goes to a website to log a request for medical help. This request includes basic contact info, symptoms, conditions as minimal and required data via pre-designed multiple choices. 

2. Once this request is submitted, the calculation service kicks in to analyse the patient’s request within a second, and categorize it to be acted upon, e.g. self-isolating, a followup call, to be tested, to be picked up by ambulance immediately etc.

3. A worker from a healthcare distribution centre then reviews the request and confirms the action to be taken for the patient. 
The action in contextual details as well as adequate self-sufficient guidance and content are then sent to the patient by a text or email. 

To see more about our system, read our [nontechnical whitepaper](zerobase-bluf.pdf).

## Why PatientAid?
When healthcare providers are overwhelemd by demand which has unfortunately emerged in several countries, they gain below benefit immediately by using our service. Therefore WHO has recently recommended the ‘patient triage tool’ in its guideline to all countries, which is exactly our service has been built for. 
* Healthcare resource efficiency
  * Limited ICU beds and health resources are utilised to likely save most lives
  * Frontline health workers are free from morally exhausting challenges to triage patients but save patients with dedicated focus and energy
  * Integrated patient self-evaluation result and resulting healthcare reduces operational waste of ambulance service and subsequent consultation. 
* Improve service levels
  * Patients at varying stages receive the most suitable healthcare tailored for individual circumstances.
  * Collaboration among healthcare providers on the network to share resources to likely help most people 
  * Offer proactive and essential healthcare to patients when their conditions worsen.  
  * Maximize opportunities to save most lives and accelerate recovery
* Costs savings
  * Reduce handling costs through enablement of flow-through distribution and cross-provider sharing
  * Reduce investment in healthcare call center labour and equipment through integrated information flow and process automation 
  * Enable efficient execution of receiving processes at distribution centers by ensuring accurate and timely availability of updated ETAs
* Reduce cycle times
  * Patients no longer need to make appointment with ambulance or consultation service providers
  * Hospitalisation preparation takes place in parallel with patient’s pickup

Many great projects are providing the patient self-checker service. We consider the people working on these efforts our siblings-in-arms and applaud their effort. PatientAid was designed to fill several significant holes in the present 'overflow' solution landscape.

### We are the only solution that brings the ultimate action to patients
Unlike other self-checker solutions in the marketplace, PatientAid aims to help the overflow problem by integrating actions of healthcare providers into patients' medical requests to complete the cycle.

### Other solutions only stop at binary answers to a fixed set of questions 

Our solution caters for finer-grained assessment criteria from healthcare providers and drives real-time actions. Those criteria are entirely configurable and tailored for each healthcare providers circumstances and needs. 


### Our service embrances and supports international collaboration 
Embedded into the intial design our solution aims to enable collaboration of a multi-healthcare provider network, allowing all network participants to act off a single version of the truth and focus resources where they are likely to save the most lives.
