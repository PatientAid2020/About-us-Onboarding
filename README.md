[Join us]() in our fight to end COVID-19.

# About Us & Onboarding
Things here are about PatientAid project and how you can get involved!

## Project Mission
Our project aims to support COVID-19 potential patients in great need of medical help, via self-service to make requests to healthcare providers, and to receive the most suitable guidance and action derived from their circumstances in an automated way. 

## How Does PatientAid Work?

PatientAid is a simple and connecting in realtime solution that can be used anywhere. Here’s how it works:

1. The patient goes to a website to log a request for medical help. The patient provides asnwers to questions related to symptoms, conditions, minimal demographic data via pre-designed multiple choices. The patient also needs to provide basic ontact info for healthcare providers to make appointment with. 

2. Once this request is submitted, entirely built upon corresponding healthcare provider's decision factors and critera, the calculation service analyzes the patient’s request within a second and categorize it to be acted upon, e.g. self-isolating, a followup call, to be tested, to be picked up by ambulance immediately etc. 

3. A worker from a healthcare distribution centre then based on the result makes and onfirms the appointment for the patient. 
The appointment in contextual details as well as adequate self-sufficient guidance and content are then sent to the patient by a text or email. 

To see more about our system, read our [nontechnical whitepaper].

## Why PatientAid?
When healthcare providers are overwhelemd by demand which has unfortunately emerged in several countries, they gain below benefit immediately by using our service. Therefore WHO has recently recommended the ‘patient triage tool’ in its guideline to all countries, which is exactly our service has been built for. 
* Healthcare resource efficiency
  * Limited ICU beds and health resources are utilised to likely save most lives
  * Frontline health workers are free from morally exhausting challenges to triage patients but save patients with dedicated focus and energy
  * Integrated patient self-evaluation result and resulting healthcare reduces operational waste of ambulance service and subsequent consultation. 
* Improve service levels
  * Patients at varying stages receive the most suitable healthcare tailored for individual circumstances.
  * Collaboration among healthcare providers on the network to share resources to likely help most people 
  * Offer proactive and essential healthcare to patients when their conditions worsen.  
  * Maximize opportunities to save most lives and accelerate recovery
* Costs savings
  * Reduce handling costs through enablement of flow-through distribution and cross-provider sharing
  * Reduce investment in healthcare call center labour and equipment through integrated information flow and process automation 
  * Enable efficient execution of receiving processes at distribution centers by ensuring accurate and timely availability of updated ETAs
* Reduce cycle times
  * Patients no longer need to make appointment with ambulance or consultation service providers
  * Hospitalisation preparation takes place in parallel with patient’s pickup

Many great projects and organisitions are providing the patient self-checker service. We consider their work our siblings-in-arms and applaud their effort. PatientAid was designed to fill a number of gaps in the present 'overflow' solution landscape.

### We are the only solution that brings the ultimate action to patients

Unlike other self-checker solutions in the marketplace, PatientAid aims to help the overflow problem by integrating actions of healthcare providers into patients' medical requests to complete the cycle.

### Most solutions evalutate upon answers to a fixed set of binary questions 

Whereas our solution caters for finer-grained assessment criteria from healthcare providers and drives real-time actions. As we position ourselves as information service providers, we do not qualify ourselves to make crucial and clinical decisions on behalf of anyone. Medical data required and corresponding criteria are entirely defined and configured under each healthcare provider's circumstances and needs. Our role is to facilitate the possibility of automation. 


### Our service embrances and supports international collaboration 

Embedded into the initial design our solution aims to enable collaboration of a multi-healthcare provider network, allowing all network participants to act off a single version of the truth and focus resources where they are likely to save the most lives. Varying from circumstances healthcare provider networks can range from local communities to international cooperation.
