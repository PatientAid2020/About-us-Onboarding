## Team Leads

### Frontend development
This includes website for patients to interact with as well as web service for healthcare call centre users to process patient requests. 

### Backend and Database
Right now the database is MySQL, and communication to frontend is through API calls, it also includes the email/message service to deliver the result to the patient. 
We want each team to have true ownership and do what they feel is right. Nothing is set in stone. If you are an expert in a software and think we should be using it, we probably want to be using it.

### Outreach
Social media. In the public and community sense, connecting with public assets from national or international health authority people to contacts in the private healthcare providers, individual and organisation partners to work with us on launch. 
People working on legal. Although patient data protection has been taken into account of current product design, we still need continuously assess the compliance especially in a global rollout context. 

### Medical consulting

They liaise with the medical professionals and health organisations to continue validating the questionnaire and calculation matrix to feed back to product and development team. They are also responsible of on boarding healthcare provider at deployment phase, review data import and provide guidance.

### Product management and UX design
