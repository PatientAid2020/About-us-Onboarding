# Contributing to PatientAid
We're so happy to have you! 

You know how every job you've applied to tells you that you'll make an immediate impact? We don't even need to tell you how your
contributions will matter, the value proposition of spending even a few hours contributing to a platform that is saving lives *now* 
speaks for itself. An investment of a few hours of your time will be directly responsible for eliminating days or weeks of unnecessary
human suffering. So let's get to it!
